There are four power settings.  From left to right these are:
A.  Heat up water to steam milk
B.  Off
C.  Heat up water to make coffee
D.  Run hot water to make espresso

Please keep the machine off when not in use.  The heating element will burn out if left on continuously.

This is designed as an espresso machine and it will work much better with coffee ground for espresso, although it will work with other grinds.

To make espresso
1.  Make sure that there is water in the water tank
2.  Flip the switch to heat the water (setting C).  The red light will be on.
3.  Wait until the light turns green.
4.  Put coffee in the filter.  Use the large filter for a double shot and the small filter for a single shot.
5.  Turn the power setting to make coffee (setting D).  Leave on until as much coffee is dispensed as you would like.
6.  Clean out coffee filter for the next person.
