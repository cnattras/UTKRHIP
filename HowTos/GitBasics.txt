git clone https://github.com/cnattras/UTKRHIP
cd Transverse_energy_analysis
touch HiFromBen.txt
git add HiFromBen.txt
git commit -m 'adding file from Ben'
git push [enter user name and password]

you should see this on the web page now
https://github.com/cnattras/UTKRHIP

Then to remove it you should be able to do
git rm HiFromBen.txt
git commit -m 'removing file from Ben'
git push [enter user name and password]

If you make local edits you can do
git diff (shows all diffs)
or
git diff filename (shows just the difference between the official file version on github and your local copy)

If you don't want to commit your changes to that file
git revert filename

If I make changes and you want to use them
git pull
will put them on your local copy of the repository
